# Plyo-App (Name still TBD)

Plyo App is a mobile application built with React Native and Expo, designed to help users stay consistent with plyometric workouts and track their vertical jump progress over time. Using computer vision, personalized programming, and social features, Plyo App makes explosive training measurable, engaging, and sustainable.

🧠 Why Plyo App?
Plyometrics are one of the most effective ways to build explosive strength and improve vertical jump — yet they’re often overlooked in favor of traditional weight training. Despite requiring just two focused jump sessions per week to see real gains, many athletes skip plyo due to lack of structure, motivation, or measurable feedback.

We created Plyo App after recognizing this problem: athletes want to jump higher, but don’t stick with consistent plyometric training. Our app aims to solve this by offering a simple and motivating way to:

Track vertical leap progress

Get personalized, low-effort plyo plans

Stay consistent through social accountability

Use cutting-edge AI to measure jumps and improve form

📱 Key Features
🔁 Personalized Plyo Programs tailored to user fitness level and goals

📷 Vertical Jump Tracking using camera-based computer vision

🧠 AI-Powered Form Feedback to improve jump technique

💪 Recovery & Strength Exercises for injury prevention

🧍‍♂️ Progress Dashboard to visualize improvements

🤝 Social Tracking to follow friends and stay motivated

🧮 Advanced Jump Estimation (coming soon): Uses height, wingspan, and motion data to estimate vertical leap with high accuracy

🎯 Mission
To make plyometric workouts more approachable, consistent, and trackable — empowering athletes and everyday users to unlock their vertical potential.
